				<p>
					I was studying film when I stumbled with his work. Of course that by
					studying film, I was going to know it in one way or another. But the
					way that I got to see his astonish directing and writing job, it was
					pure luck. The story goes like this. I had to do an analysis of a
					director who was going to be chosen at random. In order to do so, I
					had to watch at least two films by this said director. Yes, you
					guessed, I had to do it about him. After the draw, I told the
					situation to an old friend of mine who happened to know the work of
					this unknown director... Don't blame me, I was expecting to do the
					analysis about Scorsese. So, my friend gifted me the movies "Magnolia"
					and "Punch Drunk Love". I watched them in one day.
				</p>
				<p>
					After that, I kept not only thinking about the technical parts of
					them, but also about what they made me feel. No movie, until that day
					touched me so deep as Magnolia did. Without exaggeration, it blowed my
					mind. I just hadn't realized that I had spent more than three hours in
					front of the tv. Since the beginning, the story walks you throught the
					stories of ten different characters, without letting you take a
					breath. Every scene, every shot and even every dialogue seems to have
					been meticulously thought out, there is absoluteley no waste in this
					film. Little by little, the characters start to take off their masks,
					dusting off all of their miseries, their hopes, their fears,
					expectations; up to the point where there is nothing else left of
					them, other than what they really are: vulnerable human beings. Thank
					you P. T Anderson! In my opinion, there is no much directors out there
					with such an ingenius and delicate eye.
